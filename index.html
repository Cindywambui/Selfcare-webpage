                        <h3>how to take care of yourself emotionally:</h3>
                        <p>Various ways include:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Know your emotions.</strong></li>
                                <p>All of them. What are your past experiences with each emotion? Know what triggers
                                    each of
                                    them. Understand which events, and especially people, are associated with each. Do
                                    you
                                    understand why you respond emotionally the way you do? Are you satisfied that your
                                    emotional response is appropriate and reflects what you truly feel? Or, does your
                                    emotional response feel uncomfortable — for example, overreactive (or not reactive
                                    enough for the situation)? Do you feel frustrated that you can’t adequately express
                                    yourself?

                                    Knowing your emotions should help you judge how to behave when a situation arises.
                                    Each
                                    new event or interaction should not feel like the first time it’s happening. Each
                                    successive time a specific emotion is expressed gives you another opportunity to
                                    observe
                                    yourself and respond in a way that feels right (or at least better) for you.
                                </p>
                                <li><strong>Maintain healthy boundaries.</strong></li>
                                <p>
                                    How do you maintain your own emotional integrity? How do you keep others' emotions
                                    from
                                    invading your space? Are you able to recognize when others’ emotions “become” your
                                    own,
                                    or at least when others are attempting to make you “feel” the way they do and the
                                    way
                                    they want you to? Do you have strategies to protect yourself from emotional
                                    invasion?

                                    Think of a boundary as a healthy space around you. You decide how big this space
                                    needs
                                    to be for you to feel comfortable. It may be an actual space, measured as physical
                                    distance, or an imaginary psychological/emotional space. When you successfully
                                    maintain
                                    healthy emotional boundaries, you are taking care of yourself first and foremost.
                                    Once
                                    you’ve done that, you can actually deal with a situation or person more effectively,
                                    since you know what you can and will do, as well as what you will not allow to
                                    happen
                                    emotionally.
                                </p>
                                <li><strong>Cultivate your own well-being on every level.</strong></li>
                                <p>
                                    Practice self-care whenever possible. Physical care will keep you healthy and
                                    strong,
                                    better able to endure life when difficult things happen. Psychological well-being
                                    goes a
                                    long way to help sustain you, especially during life challenges when you are called
                                    upon
                                    to emotionally respond. Understanding who you are at your core, what makes you tick,
                                    how
                                    you differ from or are similar to those around you, and what your attitudes and
                                    beliefs
                                    are will help keep you on the “right track," able to stay on your path in order to
                                    accomplish what you desire. As with emotions, your psychological outlook helps keep
                                    you
                                    steady in your own life.

                                    Spiritually, cultivate a belief system that brings you hope and faith. Spiritual
                                    practice (this may be religious, but not necessarily) helps to sustain you on a
                                    daily
                                    basis, especially in trying and challenging times and with trying and challenging
                                    people.
                                </p>
                                <li><strong>Create a healthy support system.</strong></li>
                                <p>
                                    These are people who encourage and nurture you. These are people who know you, like
                                    who
                                    you are, and are willing to help you become your best self. People with no ulterior
                                    motive or private agenda. These are people you can always turn to just to listen
                                    and/or
                                    provide advice if needed.

                                    It should not be difficult to identify who in your life overwhelms you, weighs you
                                    down,
                                    worries you, makes you anxious, and/or causes you to engage in situations and
                                    relationships that are not in your best interest and that deter you from pursuing
                                    what
                                    makes you happy and contented. Sometimes it’s hard to grasp that a relationship or
                                    situation is engaging you in a negative way. But over time and with repetitive
                                    interactions, you should begin to see the bigger picture. Even if you have
                                    difficultly
                                    moving away from or limiting a relationship or situation that isn’t good for you,
                                    having
                                    a support system behind you is extremely helpful. The goal is to eventually move
                                    toward
                                    more satisfying, productive, and caring relationships that support the kind of life
                                    you
                                    want to live.
                                </p>
                                <li><strong>Create an emotional or psychological “tool box.” </strong></li>
                                <p>
                                    This is a great visual for many of these concepts. Your “tool box” is a place where
                                    you
                                    keep your coping skills — life management tools that you have acquired over time and
                                    over the course of having had numerous life experiences. These tools are strategies
                                    you
                                    have developed and used effectively to cope with challenges to your life and
                                    well-being.

                                    Over time, your personal “tool box” should come to contain everything you need. My
                                    patients know they have the tools to deal with most of what life dishes up, and they
                                    feel confident that when a challenge occurs in the future, they have what it takes
                                    to
                                    handle it. In challenging times, however, people may feel that they need to seek
                                    help in
                                    order to gain a broader perspective, and perhaps add more strategies in order to
                                    better
                                    deal with a certain situation. Anything that helps you to grow emotionally and
                                    become
                                    more grounded within yourself is always a welcome addition to your life.

                                your
                                day. Start each meal with a large glass of water before you sit down to enjoy. Also,
                                I’ve
                                found that the mindset of “how can I add more vegetables to this meal?” is a great way
                                to
                                get as many nutrients as you can throughout the day.

                                Something important to keep in mind – healthy fats are your friend. Some quick and easy
                                sources are avocados, extra virgin olive oil, salmon, flax and chia seeds.</p>

                            <p>Carving out enough time to get as much rest and sleep as possible is a very important
                                physical self care practice. When we rest, we allow our body to do its natural work like
                                detox, digest, and balance our hormones.

                                Getting enough rest at night is not the only thing you need to consider. Creating space
                                within your busy life to disconnect from the busy world and take a breather has the
                                potential to improve your overall wellness. It’s easy to get caught up in the rat-race
                                and
                                feel like we have to be on all the time in order to be productive, but sometimes, being
                                productive means completely slowing down.
                            </p>

                                <li>Wear blue-light blocking glasses for at least two hours before bed</li>
                                <li>Use an eye shade while sleeping as this will help cut down on light pollution that

                                <p>Activities like showering and brushing your teeth seem obvious. Most of us learned to
                                    do
                                    these things when we were a child. However, that’s precisely why maintaining good
                                    personal hygiene is often overlooked. It is a basic thing we learned to do so long
                                    ago
                                    that it seems unimportant when we have a big deadline coming up. The cheesy saying,
                                    “When you look good, you feel good” is actually true. Taking care of your body and
                                    dressing well help you feel confident and ready to take on the world.</p>

                                <p>Juggling work and family can be tough. It may seem self-indulgent to make time for
                                    yourself when work needs to be done, but it’s not. You are a human being first and
                                    foremost. Make time for relaxation and hang out with the people who understand you.
                                    You
                                    do not need to be productive every day. Rather than staying up all night to get that
                                    project done, get a good night’s sleep and finish it in the morning. You’ll be more
                                    focused and do a better job.</p>
                                <li>Let out your frustration</li>
                                <p>When people don’t vent their feelings, the anger and sadness can build until they
                                    explode. Everyone experiences unpleasant emotions like anger or grief. It’s normal,
                                    but
                                    you have to let it out. If you need to scream into a pillow or cry, do it. A friend
                                    of
                                    mine even likes to buy glass dishes at Goodwill and throw them onto his back patio.
                                    If
                                    you do this, make sure to wear protective gear, including long pants, adequate
                                    shoes,
                                    gloves, and safety glasses. It can be relieving to vent, as long as you do so in a
                                    healthy and safe way.</p>
                                <li>Be honest</li>
                                <p>I remember standing outside my parents’ bedroom door when I was in Elementary school.
                                    I
                                    wanted to tell them that I was sad, that something was wrong, but I was too scared.
                                    I
                                    never did tell them, and I didn’t start being completely honest about my mental
                                    illness
                                    until I was in college. By that time, things had gotten so bad that I had to be
                                    hospitalized for a week. Admitting that you’re struggling can be scary and
                                    embarrassing.
                                    If you’re not comfortable telling a family member, reach out to a friend or talk
                                    with a
                                    professional.</p>

                                    means rolling down that hill just because. Even though you may not be a kid anymore,
                                    there is still a part of you that needs to have fun and feel free. Colouring is a

                                    come

                                <p>My therapist told me about breathing exercises a few years ago. She told me to
                                    breathe in
                                    and count to seven. I held my breath for seven seconds and exhaled for another seven
                                    seconds. I felt silly and light-headed, but the next day I had a panic attack in the
                                    car. I tried the breathing exercise and was surprised that it helped. Now, it has
                                    become
                                    a part of my daily routine</p>
                                <li>Do yoga</li>
                                <p>Initially, I thought yoga was glorified stretching or a lazy way of exercising. When
                                    I
                                    began to try out different ways of dealing with stress, I tried yoga as a last
                                    resort. I
                                    remember doing Child’s Pose while rolling my eyes. To my surprise, it felt amazing.
                                    Then
                                    I felt horrible with shooting pain in my abdomen. But I had to keep the pose for at
                                    least three minutes, so I stuck with it. By the time three minutes had passed, my
                                    clenched muscles had finally relaxed, and I was in a state of bliss. I didn’t want
                                    to
                                    move. It can be hard to motivate myself to do yoga when I’m depressed, but I always
                                    thank myself afterwards.</p>
                                <li>Try Essential oils</li>
                                <p>A few of my favorite essential oils are lavender, chamomile, and mint. They helped

                                    be mindful because you focus on the pleasant scent, rather than whatever is
                                    stressing me
                                    you at that moment. you can roll essential oil on my wrist every day, dabbing it on
                                    your
                                    temples and the nape of your neck. When you take a bath, putting a few drops of
                                    essential oils in the tub to help you relax. Using essential oils can also help you
                                    with
                                    migraines and anxiety.</p>
                                <li>Use a lightbox</li>
                                <p>I was skeptical when I first heard about light therapy, but it makes sense.
                                    Lightboxes
                                    help individuals with Seasonal Affective Disorder, sleep disorders, dementia, and
                                    even
                                    jet lag. They can help elevate your mood, improve your focus, and help you sleep
                                    better.
                                    Make sure to educate yourself (as with all the suggestions here) because light
                                    therapy
                                    can trigger mania in individuals with bipolar disorder.</p>
                                <li>Get a pet</li>
                                <p>While certified therapy animals can be expensive, getting a pet doesn’t have to be. I
                                    have two pet rats that were given to me for free when my sister couldn’t keep them.
                                    When
                                    I’m lonely and depressed, I cuddle with them. Watching them munch on a piece of
                                    fruit or
                                    scurry across the floor always cheers me up. Sometimes, I let them lick peanut
                                    butter
                                    off my finger, and at night, I watch them cuddle together in their little hammock.
                                    They
                                    make me so happy.</p>
                                <li>Use herbal treatments</li>
                                <p>You don’t need to dry your own herbs to try herbal therapy. It can be as simple as
                                    drinking herbal tea to help you sleep at night. I have a mug of chamomile tea every
                                    night before bed. It helps me relax and has become a part of my evening routine.
                                    Valerian helps with insomnia, skullcap helps with stress and anxiety, and
                                    passionflower
                                    helps with panic attacks.</p>
                            </ul>
                            <li><strong>Medical treatment</strong></li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Excercise</li>
                                <p>This is another tip that seems obvious, but remember to take care of your body! That
                                    means you have to do more than brush your teeth. Exercising helps relieve stress and
                                    clears the mind, helping with anxiety, and depression. Your body was made to move.
                                    Take
                                    a walk in the park or do some yoga! Because I work from home, I make sure to take
                                    breaks
                                    and get out of the house. Taking a walk usually helps me refocus.</p>
                                <li>Change your diet</li>
                                <p>Last year, my New Year’s Resolution was to cut out soda. I did it because the
                                    caffeine
                                    and sugar made my kidneys hurt. I began to realize that my anxiety had gotten so
                                    much
                                    better too! Now, I only rarely drink coffee and try to stick to herbal teas. I also
                                    make
                                    sure to drink a lot of water. Even the smallest changes in your diet can make a big
                                    difference.</p>
                                <li>Meet with a therapist</li>
                                <p>I have been going to therapy on and off for years. It was scary at first to share my
                                    personal struggles with a stranger, but therapists are specifically trained to help
                                    you.
                                    Now, I love when it’s time to meet up and unload. She understands me and keeps me on
                                    track to achieve my goals. I can share parts of my life with her that I can’t
                                    necessarily share with everyone. She has become an essential part of my recovery.
                                </p>
                                <li>Join a support group</li>
                                <p>When I was first diagnosed with a mental illness, I felt utterly alone. I had to drop
                                    out
                                    of school, so my parents were disappointed. I couldn’t keep a job, so I lost my
                                    apartment. None of my friends seemed to understand what I was going through. Joining
                                    a
                                    support group was scary, but it was worth it. Being surrounded by non-judgmental
                                    people
                                    who knew how I felt kept me from sinking back into my depression and motivated me to
                                    keep trying.</p>
                                <li>Consider medication</li>
                                <p>The first medication I took for my mental illness was Paxil. I was 15 and thought it
                                    would solve all of my problems. While medication can help ease your symptoms, it
                                    cannot
                                    fix the underlying problem. Prescription medication may be necessary, but it is not
                                    enough without therapy and lifestyle changes. Drugs come with a list of possible
                                    side-effects. Make sure you read it, not just skim it. Over the years, I have
                                    experienced a variety of side effects… from twitching to locked-jaw to fainting.
                                    Make
                                    sure the benefits of your medication are worth the side effects. Don’t be afraid to
                                    ask
                                    your doctor why you’re being prescribed this drug and what the dangers are.</p>
                                <li>Try exposure therapy</li>
                                <p>I stumbled into exposure therapy by accident. As a teenager with Obsessive-Compulsive
                                    Disorder (OCD), I washed my hands up to three times before a meal and after going to
                                    the
                                    bathroom. I wouldn’t even eat my food if someone breathed too close to it. Being a
                                    maid
                                    was the only way I knew how to make money, though. At first, it was terrifying to
                                    clean
                                    other people’s messes. Then, it was empowering. Being able to transform a dirty
                                    house
                                    into a beautiful home was satisfying. While being a maid didn’t cure me, it did help
                                    me
                                    get to a point where my OCD was no longer impairing my ability to function.
